Trying to move the aircraft to xp12. I'm new in plane developing so maybe I cannot make it perfect, but I love tu 154.
1.0.1:
Plane can fly. Engine can run. Engine can be started from cold and dark.
-removed the screen ice effect
-edit the flight control and engine to make it work in xp12
-edit the engine starter to start the engine
issue:
-engine speed and performance might not correct because I cannot find the document about tu154 engines
-the starter is not realistic because I cannot engage air starter of engine 1 and 3 (the logic in script is right because engine 2 can be started) the only way I found is change the starter into electical starter
-the starter torque is not realistic but I cannot successfully change it either in planemaker or custom script
